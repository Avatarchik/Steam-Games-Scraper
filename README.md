Extract information from all games published in Steam thanks to its [Web API](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview), and store it in JSON format.

# ðŸ”§ Requisites

- Pyhton 3.8

# ðŸš€ Usage

Start generating data simply with:

```
python SteamGamesScraper.py
```

The first time you do, the file 'appplist.json' will be created with all the ID that facilitates Steam (>140K). In the next execution, that file will be used instead of requesting all the data again. If you want to get new IDs, simply delete the file 'appplist.json'.

Only the data of the games are saved. DLCs, music, tools, etc. are ignored and added to the file 'discarted.json' so as not to ask for them in future searches. The game IDs that Steam does not do us from information is also added. You can delete the file to ask again for those IDs.

Finally, in the file 'games.JSON' all games are stored that:

* They have already been released.
* Have the 'developers' field not empty.
* Have the price (if they are paid).

The format is this:

```
